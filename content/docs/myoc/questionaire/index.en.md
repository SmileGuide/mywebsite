## Why use the family name "Amano(天野)"?
I have been searching for a family that sounds catchy in English. The word "Ama(天)" related to the theme of this story attracted me.
## What is the origin of the name "Karlukle(カルクル)"?
I first gave the protagonist an English name "Karlukle".
Karlukle consists of two parts, *Karl* is a Germanic and Scandinavian variant of "Charles", and *Ukle* is taken from *Ukulele*.
At the same time, when translating Karlukle into Katakana, I learned from the name of Howl's apprentice in Studio Ghibli's anime film *Howl's Moving Castle(ハウルの動く城, 2004)*.
## What is the meaning of the name *Jin Chengmin(金丞旻)*?
*Min(旻)* means sky, corresponding to *Amano*.
## Why is it the *Leaf* World?
The Parallel universe is connected by the fourth dimension, which easily reminds people of countless parallel leaves on a branch.
