## My first blog.

This is the first blog I published on my personal site.  
I mainly share my thoughts on blogs and exchange technology.  
From now on, I will record my thoughts and bring help and good feelings to everyone.  

## How is this site made?

My personal site was created by Github's personal static page hosting service and Hugo, a static page building tool.

## My Heart Will Go On, by CÃ©line Dion  (Test Text)  
{{< typeit

Every night in my dreams  
I see you,I feel you  
That is how I know you go on  
Far across the distance  
And spaces between us  
You have come to show you go on  
Near far  
Wherever you are  
I believe  
That the heart does go on  
Once more you open the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Love can touch us one time  
And last for a lifetime  
And never let go till we're gone  
Love was when I loved you  
One true time I hold to  
In my life we'll always go on  
Near far  
Wherever you are  
I believe  
That the heart does go on  
Once more you open the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
you're here  
There's nothing I fear  
And I know  
That my heart will go on  
We'll stay forever this way  
You are safe in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on
